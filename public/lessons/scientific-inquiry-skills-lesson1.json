Today, you're going to learn one of the most important skills every scientist needs: <strong>how to observe like a scientist</strong>.</p><p>Imagine you're the first scientist to discover a new species of animal in the Amazon rainforest, or you've just found a mysterious rock that might be from outer space. How would you describe what you see so other scientists could understand exactly what you found?</p><p>By the end of today's lesson, you'll have the skills to make detailed scientific observations and ask the kinds of questions that lead to amazing discoveries. You'll learn the <em>exact same techniques</em> that real scientists like Jane Goodall and Charles Darwin used to change our understanding of the world.</p><p>Let's begin your scientific journey!</p>",
