Here's why:\n\nGoldfish are cold-blooded (ectothermic), meaning they can't regulate their internal temperature like humans can - their body temperature matches their environment. When the water reaches 35Â°C, the goldfish's body temperature also becomes 35Â°C.\n\nThis disrupts homeostasis because:\n1. Enzymes in the fish's body work best at specific temperatures. At 35Â°C, many enzymes may not function properly, disrupting digestion, respiration, and other vital processes.\n2. The warmer water holds less dissolved oxygen, making it harder for the fish to get enough oxygen through its gills.\n3. The fish's metabolism speeds up in warm water, requiring more oxygen just when less is available.\n4. The fish cannot sweat, shiver, or move to a cooler location to maintain homeostasis.\n\nThis shows why maintaining stable environmental conditions is crucial for organisms that cannot fully regulate their internal conditions.",
