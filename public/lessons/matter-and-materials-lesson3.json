Today, we're going on an exciting journey to discover how matter can change!</p><p>Have you ever watched an ice cube melt? Or seen a campfire turn wood into ash? These are just two examples of the incredible changes matter can undergo. Some changes are reversible (like melting ice), while others create entirely new substances (like burning wood).</p><p>In this lesson 3 of Matter and Materials, you'll become a change detective, learning to spot the difference between physical and chemical changes, understand why matter never truly disappears, and discover the energy secrets hidden in every transformation!</p><p>Ready to unlock the mysteries of changing matter?
